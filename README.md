# Fine-Tuning-BERT-for-text-classification-with-LoRA

* Fine-tuning is a widely employed technique that enables the customization of pre-trained language models for particular tasks.

* In recent times, various research papers have presented different techniques to fine-tune LLMs in a shorter amount of time and with reduced computational demands. One of the most prominent techniques that has yielded state-of-the-art results is **Low Rank Adaptation (LORA)**. This research was conducted by Metaâ€™s AI team. 

* In this tutorial, I will demonstrate how to fine-tune BERT using the **LORA** approach.
